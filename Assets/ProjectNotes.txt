PROJECT NOTES

TO DO
- Use [field: SerializeField] [DONE]
- Rewrite code for action queuing [DONE]
  - Action state continually checks if chain is executing
  - Switch state logic is in action state instead of ActionQueue
- Implement skillset using ScriptableObjects
- Implement skill UI
- Rework progression system
  - Levels are bought
  - Party shares level
  - Skills level at certain party levels
- Fix targeting
- Redo input system
  - Make more event driven [DONE]
  - Implement delegates (performed, canceled) for roll/guard hold interaction (check Udemy) [DONE]
	- Check roll input
- Redo animation structure (anim on CharacterModel) [DONE]
  - No root motion
  - Create animation event functions in CharacterModel
- BUG: Character freezes if an action is pressed the moment and action ends	[FIXED]
- Look at single camera for party controller
  - Currently camera moves when switching as values are not shared between camera
- CONSIDER REWRITING PLAYER PARTY CONTROLLER
  - CharacterController, Controller on party level
  - Animator, Movement, Combatant on model level
  - Models are attached as children of party instead of controllers
    - Characters share movement functionality
  - PROGRESS
    - 1st char model rotates, 2nd char doesn't


IDEAS
- Max stamina gradually [DITCHED]
  - Very slow with time
  - Slow with movement
  - Actions have max sp costs
  - Purpose is to serve as hunger meter
- Use MP bar instead of actions having individual uses
- Guard vs roll
  - 90 resistance points spread between guard and roll
  - 1 res. point = 1% reduced damage (if timed well for rolls)
- Teleportation
